# The Open SRC Project
This is my first project, where I make many open source programs, discordbots, or whatever I feel like, Open Source is a good idea, allowing others to learn much more
easily from your work will probably make you feel good about it.
We all start of somewhere so why not support Open Source communitys? Here is my first open source release!
